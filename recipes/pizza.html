        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        
        <p> 
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. Add the flour, salt, and 2 tbsp of olive oil. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. </li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>First Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn it over to coat. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. </li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> While the dough is rising, mix the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, and oregano in a small bowl. Set aside. (No cooking is required for a fresh-tasting sauce).</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to its highest setting (usually 250°C / 500°F). If you have a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Once risen, punch down the dough and divide it in two (this recipe makes two pizzas). On a floured surface, gently stretch or roll one piece of dough into a 12-inch (30cm) circle.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong> Transfer the shaped dough to a piece of parchment paper or a lightly floured pizza peel. Spread half of the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Arrange half of the fresh mozzarella slices over the sauce.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Carefully slide the pizza (on the parchment paper, if using) onto the hot pizza stone or a preheated baking sheet. Bake for 8-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly charred.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven. Top it immediately with fresh basil leaves, a final drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and a sprinkle of Parmesan (if using). Slice and serve hot.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Repeat:</strong> Repeat steps 6-10 for the second pizza.</li>
            </ol>
