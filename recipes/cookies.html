        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p> 
            This recipe is for the <strong>perfect</strong> chocolate chip cookie. 
            It delivers a cookie that is <em>satisfyingly crispy</em> on the edges but wonderfully soft and chewy in the center.
            They are the ultimate comfort food.
        </p>
        <p>
            The secret to their texture is using melted butter and an extra egg yolk, which ensures they stay moist. 
            These cookies are <em>dangerously</em> easy to make and even harder to resist.

                <li> <strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 180°C (375°F). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. </li>

                <br>
                <li> <strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are still slightly soft.</li>
                <br>
                <li> <strong>Cool:</strong> Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
